# PHP Playground — Beginner Projects & Best Practices

This is my **PHP Playground**, a growing collection of beginner-friendly PHP examples, exercises, and projects!  
Everything here is built to help me understand **how things really work**.

Most of these projects are inspired by **real school assignments** and early-stage web development tasks.
